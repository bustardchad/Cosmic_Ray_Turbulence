# analysis_forCRTurb
Directory of Python scripts using the yt visualization and analysis toolkit
Specifically for analyzing cosmic ray + turbulence simulations from Bustard and Oh 2022a,b

Main files are:
  turb_spectrum_average.py -- calculates power spectrum of kinetic energy
  turb_spectrum_heating.py -- calculates power spectrum of CR heating rate
  turb_spectrum_heating_stats.py -- same as above, using a different method as a consistency check
